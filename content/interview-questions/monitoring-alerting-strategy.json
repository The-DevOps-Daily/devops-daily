  "question": "How do you design a monitoring and alerting strategy? What metrics would you track and how do you avoid alert fatigue?",
  "answer": "Start with the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Use RED method for services (Rate, Errors, Duration) and USE method for resources (Utilization, Saturation, Errors). To avoid alert fatigue: alert on symptoms not causes, set appropriate thresholds with historical data, use severity levels (page vs ticket), implement alert grouping and deduplication, require runbooks for every alert, and regularly review and tune alerts. Only page for actionable issues that require immediate human intervention.",
  "explanation": "Effective monitoring enables proactive issue detection and faster incident resolution. Poor alerting leads to alert fatigue where important signals get ignored. This is a critical skill for maintaining reliable systems.",
