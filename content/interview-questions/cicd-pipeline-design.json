  "question": "How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application? What stages would you include?",
  "answer": "A comprehensive pipeline includes: 1) Build stage - compile code, install dependencies. 2) Test stage - unit tests, integration tests, code coverage. 3) Security scanning - SAST, dependency scanning, container scanning. 4) Artifact creation - build and push Docker images. 5) Deploy to staging - automated deployment with smoke tests. 6) Performance/E2E tests - load testing, end-to-end tests. 7) Deploy to production - with approval gates, canary or blue-green deployment. Include notifications, rollback mechanisms, and artifact versioning throughout.",
  "explanation": "Pipeline design impacts developer productivity, deployment frequency, and system reliability. A well-designed pipeline catches issues early, provides fast feedback, and enables confident production deployments. This is a core DevOps competency.",
