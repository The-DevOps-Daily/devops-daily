  "title": "Security Architecture and DevSecOps",
  "question": "How do you integrate security into the DevOps pipeline? Describe the key components of a secure architecture.",
  "answer": "DevSecOps shifts security left by integrating it throughout the pipeline: 1) Pre-commit: secrets scanning, linting. 2) CI: SAST (static analysis), dependency scanning, container scanning. 3) CD: DAST (dynamic testing), infrastructure security scanning. 4) Runtime: WAF, network policies, runtime protection. Architecture security includes: defense in depth (multiple security layers), zero trust (verify everything, trust nothing), least privilege access, encryption at rest and in transit, network segmentation, and comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events.",
  "explanation": "Security is a shared responsibility in modern DevOps. Understanding how to build security into systems from the start, rather than bolting it on later, is essential for senior engineers. Security breaches can have severe business and legal consequences.",
