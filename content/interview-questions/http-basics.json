  "question": "What are the main HTTP methods and what do common status codes like 200, 404, and 500 mean?",
  "answer": "The main HTTP methods are: GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update/replace data), PATCH (partial update), and DELETE (remove data). Status code 200 means success, 201 means created, 301/302 are redirects, 400 is bad request, 401 is unauthorized, 403 is forbidden, 404 is not found, and 500 is internal server error. Understanding these is essential for API troubleshooting.",
  "explanation": "HTTP is the foundation of web communication. DevOps engineers troubleshoot APIs, configure load balancers, set up monitoring, and read access logs daily. Knowing HTTP methods and status codes helps quickly diagnose issues and communicate with developers effectively.",
