  "question": "Explain the difference between TCP and UDP. When would you use each?",
  "answer": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable, ordered delivery with error checking and retransmission. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, offering faster but unreliable delivery without guarantees. Use TCP for web traffic (HTTP), file transfers, and email. Use UDP for streaming, gaming, DNS queries, and real-time applications where speed matters more than reliability.",
  "explanation": "Understanding TCP vs UDP is fundamental for troubleshooting network issues, configuring firewalls, and designing distributed systems. DevOps engineers must know which protocol applications use to properly monitor, secure, and optimize network traffic.",
