  "question": "What are common Git branching strategies? Describe GitFlow or trunk-based development.",
  "answer": "Common strategies include GitFlow (feature branches, develop, release, and main branches with structured releases), GitHub Flow (simple feature branches merged to main with continuous deployment), and trunk-based development (short-lived branches or direct commits to main with feature flags). Trunk-based development is preferred for CI/CD as it reduces merge conflicts and enables faster delivery.",
  "explanation": "Branching strategies directly impact deployment frequency and team collaboration. DevOps engineers help teams choose and implement strategies that support their CI/CD goals. Understanding trade-offs helps optimize the development workflow.",
