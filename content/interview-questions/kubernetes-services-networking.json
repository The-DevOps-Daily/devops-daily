  "question": "Explain the different types of Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and when to use each.",
  "answer": "ClusterIP (default) exposes the service on an internal IP, accessible only within the cluster - use for internal communication between pods. NodePort exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port (30000-32767) - use for development or when you manage your own load balancer. LoadBalancer provisions an external load balancer (in cloud environments) - use for production external traffic. Ingress is not a service type but a separate resource for HTTP/HTTPS routing with a single entry point.",
  "explanation": "Kubernetes networking is essential for connecting microservices and exposing applications. Understanding service types helps architects design secure, scalable systems and troubleshoot connectivity issues efficiently.",
